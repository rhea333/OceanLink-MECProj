# OceanLink

## Description

OceanLink is the project my team created for the McMaster Engineering Challenge, in which we finished 2nd place!

The task we were challenged with was creating an ocean navigation system, so our group developed an application that allows ship captains to get updates on 
ocean/weather conditions such as wind, fog, nearby objects, and tide height. 

We were not allowed to use real sensors to get this data, so instead we used functions to simulate the output for the fog, windspeed and distance sensor, and used 
a tide height API to get data for the tide height.

There are 6 user configurable inputs, Lattitude and Longitude are used for the tide height, and Distance, Radius, Speed, and Time of Day are used to determine nearby
objects.
